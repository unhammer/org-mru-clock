#+TITLE: org-mru-clock

[[https://melpa.org/#/org-mru-clock][https://melpa.org/packages/org-mru-clock-badge.svg]]

Do you often clock in to many different little tasks? Are you annoyed
that you can't just clock in to one of your most recent tasks after
restarting Emacs?

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt org-mru-clock demo
[[file:org-mru-clock.gif][file:org-mru-clock.gif]]

The function =org-mru-clock-in= from this package will pre-fill your
clock history with clocks from your agenda files (and other open org
files) so you can clock in to your most recent clocks regardless of
whether you just started Emacs or have had it running for
decades. Tasks are sorted by recency, and uses completing-read for
quick selection. This makes it a nice replacement for
=org-clock-in-last=.

It uses =completing-read-function= (overridable with
=org-mru-clock-completing-read=) on =org-mru-clock-in= to make
clocking in faster. If you set that to =ivy-completing-read=, you can
hit =M-o g= to visit to the task heading instead of clocking in.

The list is sorted to keep the most recently clocked entry first,
although if the entry at point is an org-mode heading (in an org file
or the agenda), then that will be pushed to the top of the list (you
can turn off this behaviour by setting
=org-mru-clock-include-entry-at-point= to =nil=).

You can also use =org-mru-clock-select-recent-task= as a replacement
for =org-clock-select-task=, again with pre-filled history.

You may also capture new tasks on the fly if your search text didn't
match anything – try =C-h v org-mru-clock-capture-if-no-match RET=.

* Installation

** MELPA
If you use [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]], you can just do =M-x list-packages=, find
=org-mru-clock= in the list and hit =i x=.

** Manual
Just put =org-mru-clock.el= somewhere in =load-path=.


* Usage

** Manual, loading on startup:

To use, require and bind whatever keys you prefer to the
interactive functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org-mru-clock)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-x i") #'org-mru-clock-in)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-x C-j") #'org-mru-clock-select-recent-task)
#+END_SRC

Maybe trade some initial slowness for more tasks cached:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-mru-clock-how-many 100)
#+END_SRC

But don't set it higher than the actual number of tasks; then
it'll always try (and fail) to fill up the history cache!

If you want to use ivy for =org-mru-clock-in=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-mru-clock-completing-read #'ivy-completing-read)
#+END_SRC

** With use-package

If you prefer =use-package=, the above settings would be:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package org-mru-clock
  :ensure t
  :bind* (("C-c C-x i" . org-mru-clock-in)
          ("C-c C-x C-j" . org-mru-clock-select-recent-task))
  :init
  (setq org-mru-clock-how-many 100
        org-mru-clock-completing-read #'ivy-completing-read))
#+END_SRC

** Other org-mru-clock settings

If you do
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-mru-clock-keep-formatting t)
#+END_SRC
then entries will be shown in their org-mode faces, instead of
whatever face your =org-mru-clock-completing-read= function uses by
default.

If you do
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-mru-clock-include-entry-at-point nil)
#+END_SRC
then the entry at point will /not/ be prepended to the start of the
list.

By default, all open =org-mode= files are searched for recent clocks,
but you can change this to e.g. only the =org-agenda-files= with
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-mru-clock-files #'org-agenda-files)
#+END_SRC
or some other function of your own devising.

You can also exclude clocks by setting =org-mru-clock-predicate= to
e.g. =org-entry-is-todo-p= (which will exclude DONE tasks) or
=org-mru-clock-exclude-done-and-archived= (which will also exclude
those tagged with =org-archive-tag=).
